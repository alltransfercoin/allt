### Why I should use ALLT Coin? 
You know the issue with payouts after you've made a profit on a sale and the bitcoin fees are higher than the profit? 
We want to have a coin and combine with other coins that a payout via other coins is much faster and in addition cheaper in transfer. 
With Bitcoin, the withdrawal fees are also times 0.0008 BTC which can already shrink the entire profit for smaller trades. 
In addition, it sometimes takes several hours before the Bitcoin is even booked. 
The goal is to offer in a network of coins between many exchanges an exchange possibility with stable same prices to enable arbitrage trading even with small sums and also to send smaller sum times quickly from one exchange to another!
